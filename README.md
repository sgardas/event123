## What is the EventHawkAPI:

The EventHawkAPI is the backend application responsible for managing and serving Events and their associated resources, such as Users and Reviews. It resides in a separate Git project because of constraints in Heroku. For information on the main EventHawk projects, navigate [here](https://github.com/sv-uml/EventHawk).
